Enter consultation mode for questions and discussions.

This command activates a consultation session where I will:
- Answer questions about the codebase, architecture, or implementation approaches
- Provide technical guidance and recommendations
- Discuss best practices and design patterns
- Review code and suggest improvements
- Help with debugging and troubleshooting

**Important:** During consultation mode, I will NOT make any code changes, create files, or modify the codebase. This is purely for discussion and guidance.

To exit consultation mode and return to implementation, simply ask me to "implement" or "make changes" to something specific.
