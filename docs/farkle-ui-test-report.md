# Farkle Game UI Test Report

**Test Date:** 2025-06-21  
**Test Environment:** Local development server (http://localhost:3000/farkle)

## Overview

This report documents the UI testing results for the Farkle game, identifying bugs, improvements, and overall functionality assessment.

## Test Coverage

‚úÖ **Completed Tests:**
- Initial game load and tutorial system
- Dice rolling functionality
- Dice selection mechanism
- Scoring system validation
- Scoring guide display
- Rules modal navigation
- New game functionality

## Critical Bugs Found

### üö® 1. Major Scoring Bug - Incorrect Three-of-a-Kind Calculation
**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:** Three 1s are incorrectly scored as 200 points instead of 1,000 points.
- **Expected:** Three 1s = 1,000 points (as shown in rules)
- **Actual:** Three 1s = 200 points
- **Impact:** Core game logic is broken, making the game unplayable with correct scoring

### üö® 2. Dice Value Display Mismatch
**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:** Visual dice show different values than what the scoring system reads.
- **Visual:** Three 1s selected (with yellow highlight)
- **Scoring Guide:** Shows "Selected Dice: 2, 2, 2" and "Available Combinations (4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5)"
- **Impact:** Players cannot trust what they see vs. what is actually scored

### üêõ 3. Placeholder Data in Scoring Guide
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** After clicking "New Game", the scoring guide shows placeholder data.
- **Issue:** Shows "Available Combinations (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)" with "6 1s = 8000 pts"
- **Expected:** Should show actual dice values or be hidden until dice are rolled

## UI/UX Issues

### üîß 4. Modal Accessibility
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Rules modal doesn't close with Escape key, requires navigation through all pages.
- **Current:** Must click through all tutorial pages to close
- **Improvement:** Add Escape key support and close button on each page

### üîß 5. Bank Button State Logic
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Bank button shows "(200)" but remains disabled due to 500-point minimum.
- **Current:** "Bank (200)" button is grayed out with no clear indication why
- **Improvement:** Add tooltip or text explaining the 500-point minimum requirement

## Functional Features Working Correctly

‚úÖ **Tutorial System:** All three tutorial pages display correctly with proper Japanese text and navigation  
‚úÖ **Dice Visual Selection:** Dice highlight in yellow when selected  
‚úÖ **Rules Modal:** Complete navigation through scoring rules and game mechanics  
‚úÖ **New Game:** Successfully resets game state  
‚úÖ **First Score Minimum Warning:** Properly displays warning about 500-point minimum  
‚úÖ **Responsive Design:** UI scales appropriately and maintains readability  

## Scoring Rules Verification

**From Tutorial (Correct):**
- 1 = 100 points
- 5 = 50 points  
- Three 1s = 1,000 points
- Three 2s = 200 points
- Three 3s = 300 points
- etc.

**Actual Implementation (Incorrect):**
- Three 1s scoring as 200 points (should be 1,000)
- Dice value detection appears broken

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. **Fix scoring calculation** - Three 1s must equal 1,000 points
2. **Fix dice value detection** - Ensure visual dice match internal game state
3. **Remove placeholder data** - Clean up scoring guide after new game

### UX Improvements
1. **Add escape key support** for modal closing
2. **Improve bank button feedback** - Show why button is disabled
3. **Add visual feedback** for minimum score requirements
4. **Consider adding** dice rolling animation for better game feel

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Create automated tests** for scoring calculations
2. **Add unit tests** for dice value detection
3. **Test all scoring combinations** (straights, pairs, etc.)
4. **Verify hot dice functionality** (not tested in this session)

## Conclusion

The Farkle game has a solid UI foundation with excellent Japanese localization and tutorial system. However, **critical bugs in the core scoring system make the game currently unplayable**. The disconnect between visual dice display and internal game state is a serious issue that needs immediate attention.

The game shows promise with its clean design and comprehensive tutorial, but the scoring bugs must be resolved before it can be considered functional.
